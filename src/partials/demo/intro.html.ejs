<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I've been building different kind of website for quite a long time now, and i've seen myself having similar routine. Thinking about form and button, firefox and IE8, make sure grunt handle of every task possible.</p>
<p>This is what i use as a very basic boilerplate for all my project. Simple logicisare already set in place (grid, media query, UI element) but the code is extremly simple &amp; maleable. Build, server and templating task are present and let me start a new project instantly.</p>
<p>This is a concept-free boilerplate, good for webapp, blog, forum or any other kind of website. That's one of the reason why the <strong>spacing</strong> is separated in is own file. (webapp think about spacing differently that classical website).</p>
<p>Another main concept is the use of <strong>rem</strong> (main.css) with a <strong>fallback to px</strong> (main-no-rem.css) for non-supportive browser. Using rem system (with help of the rem build-in mixin) assure a consistant layout around all the site. try to change the body font-size and you'll see that everything is responding to that unique value</p>
<div class="inline-input">
	<label for="font-experiment-range">body font-size</label>
	<input id="font-experiment-range" value="16" type="range" min="10" max="20">
	<small id="actual-font-size">16px</small>
</div>
